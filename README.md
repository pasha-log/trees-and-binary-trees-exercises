# Tree and Binary Tree Exercises

* Iâ€™ve been supplied with a BinaryTreeNode class, a TreeNode class, a constructor for a BinaryTree class and a constructor for a more general Tree class (this is an n-ary tree).

## Trees
* Here are descriptions of the methods I wrote for Tree:

#### sumValues
* Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the sum of all the integers.

#### countEvens
* Given a n-ary tree of integers, return the count of all the even integers.

#### numGreater
* Given a n-ary tree and a number x, find and return the number of nodes which are greater than x.

## Binary Trees
* Here are descriptions of the methods I wrote for BinaryTree:

#### minDepth
* Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

#### maxDepth
* Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth. The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from root node down to the nearest leaf node.

#### maxSum
* Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and end at any node in the tree, but no node can be visited more than once.

#### nextLarger
* Given a binary tree and a integer x. Find and return the value of the node with next larger element in the tree i.e. find a node with value just greater than x. Return null if no node is present with value greater than x.
